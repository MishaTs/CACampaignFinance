Dataset:	2012 Primary Election Precinct Data

Description:	Statewide Statement of Vote data files containing precinct level voting results for statewide races.

Unit of analysis:  SR precincts are derived from consolidated precincts and are a geographic unit constructed for statistical merging purposes by the Statewide Database.

Data source:	Statewide Database - University of California, Berkeley

Technical documentation:	http://statewidedatabase.org/d10/Creating%20CA%20Official%20Redistricting%20Database.pdf

Codebook: 2012 Primary Election Statement of Vote County code books

The SOV data codebooks are county and election specific because the district races and 
candidates who ran in those races vary by county and election. 

The 58 Statement of Vote county codebooks can be accessed from the election's precinct data table,
http://statewidedatabase.org/d10/p12.html

To use the Statement of Vote county codebooks to determine the names of the candidates that were on a ballot in a given
precinct, retrieve the district number from the table/ file for that precinct record. The 
Assembly, Board of Equalization, Congressional and Senate district that each precinct is located in are listed in
the columns ADDIST,BEDIST CDDIST and SDDIST in the SOV data files. Some instances will be all zeros
if there were no candidates for that party in that race.
